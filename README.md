For this project the data set is from Kaggle, called “Rain in Australia”. This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.
RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.

For the modelling part 4 models have been used:
•	Logistic Regression
•	Random Forest Classifier
•	Decision Trees
•	Ada Boost Classifier

For dimensionality reduction in combination with the upper models we have the followings:
•	PCA
•	SVD
•	Random Forest Built-in Feature Importance

Lastly a comparison between the models was performed to see which outputs the best result.
