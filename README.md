For this project we have chosen a data set from Kaggle, called “Rain in Australia”. This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.
RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.

For the modelling part we have used the following 4 models:
•	Logistic Regression
•	Random Forest Classifier
•	Decision Trees
•	Ada Boost Classifier

For dimensionality reduction in combination with the upper models we have used:
•	PCA
•	SVD
•	Random Forest Built-in Feature Importance

We have compared the models to see which performs best.
